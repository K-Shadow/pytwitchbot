# TODO

- Add SSL connection support
- Finish implementing Twitch protocol commands (almost done, kinda)
- Work on user permission system quite a bit
- Implement chat logging
- Work on making the module system more streamlined and flexible (kind of ties into permission system as well)
- Work on adding more included modules
- Figure out a method to integrate other platforms (Discord, IRC)
- Document the process of making modules for the bot, as well as documenting how to use the bot in general
- There's more... just have to sit down and remember them

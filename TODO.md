# TODO

- Implement better logging
- Work on user permission system quite a bit
- Work on making the module system more streamlined and flexible (kind of ties into permission system as well)
- Possibly switch from using MySQL to something more practical for this purpose
- Add Discord functionality
- There's more... just have to sit down and remember them

# TODO (in order of what I plan to do)

- Work on user permission system quite a bit
- Implement chat logging
- Work on making the module system more streamlined and flexible (kind of ties into permission system as well)
- Work on Discord integration (currently experimental support for Discord, simple chat relay)
- Work on adding more included modules
- Implement other platforms for the bot to run on (IRC, etc)
- Document the process of making modules for the bot, as well as documenting how to use the bot in general
- There's more... just have to sit down and remember them
